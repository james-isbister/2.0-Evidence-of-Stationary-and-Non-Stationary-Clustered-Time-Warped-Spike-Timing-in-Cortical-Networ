%<*ClusterTimeSpanSummary>
For angled clusters extracted between cortical onset and 100ms following stimulus onset, 94.7\% of the cluster bounds for single units (mean + $4\sigma$) lied within 50ms following cortical onset (Fig. 3c). Spikes within a 50ms window following cortical onset were analysed to allow comparison of coding potential for clustered and unclustered statistics calculated over a reasonable timescale.
